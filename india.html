                <p>India's diverse geography and climate support a rich variety of native trees, many of which hold deep cultural and religious significance.</p>
                
                <h3>The Banyan Tree (<i>Ficus benghalensis</i>)</h3>
                <p>The national tree of India, the Banyan is famous for its massive canopy and its "prop roots" that grow down from the branches to the ground, forming new trunks. A single Banyan tree can resemble a small forest. It is considered sacred in Hinduism and is often found near temples.</p>
                
                <h3>The Peepal Tree (<i>Ficus religiosa</i>)</h3>
                <p>Also known as the Bodhi tree, the Peepal is sacred to both Hindus and Buddhists. It is believed that Gautama Buddha attained enlightenment while meditating under a Peepal tree. It is easily recognized by its heart-shaped leaves with a long, extended tip.</p>

                <h3>The Neem Tree (<i>Azadirachta indica</i>)</h3>
                <p>Known as the "village pharmacy," nearly every part of the Neem tree has medicinal properties. It is widely used in traditional Ayurvedic medicine for its antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral qualities. Its leaves, bark, and seeds are used in a variety of products.</p>
                
                <h3>The Sal Tree (<i>Shorea robusta</i>)</h3>
                <p>A large, deciduous tree that is one of the most important sources of hardwood timber in India. Sal forests are prominent in the central and eastern parts of the country. It is also significant in Hindu and Buddhist traditions.</p>
