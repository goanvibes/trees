                <p>Goa's coastal, tropical climate makes it a haven for a variety of lush, fruit-bearing, and economically important trees that are deeply integrated into the local culture and cuisine.</p>
                
                <h3>Coconut Palm (<i>Cocos nucifera</i>)</h3>
                <p>Perhaps the most iconic tree of Goa, the Coconut Palm lines its famous beaches and inland waterways. It is often called the "tree of life" as every part of it is used â€“ the fruit for food and oil, the husk for coir, the leaves for thatching roofs, and the trunk for timber. It is central to Goan cuisine.</p>
                
                <h3>Mango Tree (<i>Mangifera indica</i>)</h3>
                <p>Goa is renowned for its many varieties of mangoes, with the Mancurado being one of the most prized. Mango trees are a common sight in gardens and orchards across the state, and the fruit is a celebrated part of the summer season.</p>

                <h3>Jackfruit Tree (<i>Artocarpus heterophyllus</i>)</h3>
                <p>The jackfruit tree produces the largest tree-borne fruit in the world. In Goa, both the raw and ripe fruits are used in a wide range of dishes, from savory curries to sweet desserts. The wood of the tree is also valued for making furniture.</p>
                
                <h3>Cashew Tree (<i>Anacardium occidentale</i>)</h3>
                <p>Introduced by the Portuguese, the cashew tree now grows wild across Goa. It is famous for two products: the cashew nut and the cashew apple. The fleshy apple is fermented and distilled to produce Feni, Goa's traditional and popular local spirit.</p>
