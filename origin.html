                <p>The story of trees begins hundreds of millions of years ago. The first true trees appeared during the Devonian Period, around 385 million years ago. Before this, the land was dominated by much smaller plants, like mosses and ferns.</p>
                <p>One of the earliest known tree-like plants was <b>Wattieza</b>. These ancient plants did not have the broad leaves we see today; instead, they had fronds. Their evolution was a critical moment in Earth's history. The development of wood (lignin) allowed them to grow tall, competing for sunlight and spreading their spores over greater distances.</p>
                
                <h3>Key Milestones:</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li><b>Late Devonian Period (~385 mya):</b> Appearance of the first tree-like plants such as Wattieza.</li>
                  <li><b>Carboniferous Period (~359 mya):</b> Known as the "Age of Forests," vast swamp forests dominated the landscape.</li>
                  <li><b>Triassic Period (~252 mya):</b> Rise of the gymnosperms, including conifers, which could survive in drier climates.</li>
                  <li><b>Cretaceous Period (~145 mya):</b> Emergence of angiosperms (flowering plants), the dominant type of tree today.</li>
                </ul>
