                <p>While there are thousands of species, most trees can be broadly categorized into two main groups based on their foliage and method of reproduction: <b>Angiosperms</b> (often deciduous broad-leaf trees) and <b>Gymnosperms</b> (often evergreen conifers).</p>

                <h3>Deciduous Trees</h3>
                <p>Deciduous trees are famous for shedding their leaves annually, usually in the autumn. This is a survival strategy to conserve water and energy during cold or dry seasons. Their broad leaves are excellent at capturing sunlight for photosynthesis during the growing season.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><b>Examples:</b> Oak, Maple, Birch, Aspen</li>
                  <li><b>Characteristics:</b> Broad leaves, seasonal leaf-fall, often produce flowers and fruits.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                
                <h3>Evergreen Trees</h3>
                <p>Evergreen trees retain their leaves (or needles) year-round, shedding them gradually rather than all at once. This allows them to photosynthesize whenever conditions are favorable, even during winter. Many evergreens are conifers, which reproduce using cones instead of flowers.</p>
                 <ul>
                  <li><b>Examples:</b> Pine, Spruce, Fir, Cedar</li>
                  <li><b>Characteristics:</b> Typically have needles or scales instead of broad leaves, produce cones, and stay green all year.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><i>Note: There are exceptions! For example, the Larch is a deciduous conifer (it has needles and cones but loses them in the fall), and some broad-leaf trees in tropical climates are evergreen.</i></p>
