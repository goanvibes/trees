                <p>A tree is a perennial plant with an elongated stem, or trunk, usually supporting branches and leaves. In botanical terms, trees are defined by their woody tissue and their ability to grow in height and girth year after year (secondary growth).</p>
                
                <h3>Basic Anatomy of a Tree</h3>
                <p>The three main parts of a tree are the <b>Roots</b>, the <b>Trunk</b>, and the <b>Crown</b>.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><b>The Crown:</b> This is the top part of the tree, which includes the leaves, branches, and twigs. The crown is where photosynthesis, the process of converting sunlight into energy, primarily occurs.</li>
                  <li><b>The Trunk:</b> The trunk provides support for the crown and houses the tree's vascular system, which transports water and nutrients between the roots and the leaves.</li>
                  <li><b>The Roots:</b> The root system anchors the tree in the ground and absorbs water and essential minerals from the soil.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>The Rings of a Tree</h3>
                <p>A tree's age can often be determined by counting the annual growth rings in its trunk. Each ring represents one year of growth and is composed of two layers:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Springwood:</b> A wide, light-colored layer that grows during the spring when there is ample water.</li>
                    <li><b>Summerwood:</b> A thinner, darker layer that grows in the summer when growth slows.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>The thickness of these rings can also tell a story about the environmental conditions of that year, such as rainfall and temperature.</p>
